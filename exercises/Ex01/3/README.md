# **EXERCISE 1B: CREATE NEW MAG**

In this exercise you have to create your own mapping to map from the IDoc Order Response Message to the EDIFACT OrdRsp Message. For each mapping you need a source and a target MIG. The source MIG has already been created by us and the target MIG had been created by yourself in the last exercise.
